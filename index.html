                        <p>I worked on the Consortium Sales Application Online from conception to product launch. Following the design thinking methodology, I made sure our team understood the problems and worked to deliver business goals with a delightful product using quantitative information.</p>

                        <h1>Visual Update for Presentations</h1>
                        <p>I reviewed some of Consortium presentation decks and they were pretty dated. I made improvements by simply applying some of the current design standards.</p>
                        <p>Some of these standards include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Slide Size – I noticed the presentation were still created using the 4:3 ratio. Updated them to a widescreen 16:9 ratio. It looked much better, and also gave more on screen space.</li>
                            <li>Colors – The palette were a bit dated. I wanted to introduce more vibrate colors to bring excitement and give life to the message.</li>
                            <li>Fonts – Updated the font-types and gave a good visual mix to keep the audience interested.</li>
                            <li>Layout – Added variety to the layout, and spaced out the content in to  "bite size", so it’s easy to consume compared to a big wall of text.</li>
                            <li>Stories – Added cover slides of the story or real life examples to engage the audience in to the presentation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </span>

                        <h1>Error Page Handlers For People</h1>
                        <p>Users didn't know or care what error 500, 403, or 404 actually are.</p>
                        <p>Through testing, users are more forgiving when errors were handled this way to lighten the mood. When technical terms were thrown around, they just thought "What's wrong with this app?" or "I can't use it, the system is down". The comments were expressing the frustration by the interruptions of the error messages.</p>
                        <p>I updated the technical terms with human language. Then, I illustrated various error page handlers with fun and vibrant colors related to the product. When the error pages were updated with people speak, "Sorry, please try again later". Users' comments were more forgiving: "Oh, I'll just try again later", "I'll just take a break and use it when it's back". I was able to guide the users away from feeling frustrated and willing to make another attempt.</p>
                        <p>Bad things happen, even to products. From my experience, users are reasonable -- just speak in a language they understand and be honest.</p>

                        <h1>Data Visualization with D3</h1>
                        <p>Here at Consortium we have the largest collection of health care data analytics in the world. All of the plans at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association rely on our data. For a visual person like myself... they're all pretty boring. I worked to visualize the data using D3.js library and bring them to life by applying animations and transitions, to an otherwise rows and columns of data in spreadsheets.</p>
                        <p>I designed and created custom charts that were not in the library.</p>
                        <p>I worked closely with developers how to handle the zooms, drill up/down, charts interactions, and filters. I did not develop the code, but I know enough to be able to go in and make changes myself.</p>

                        <h1>Fail Fast and Early with Wireframes</h1>
                        <p>I created lots of prototypes (and I mean lots). More often than not, the ideas birth of my ideas are briefly drawn on a whiteboard.</p>
                        <p>Then, I create low-fidelity wireframes using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> to rapidly go broad with my design. Once the design is narrowed, I switch over to <a href="https://www.axure.com/" target="_blank">Axure RP</a> and create interactive prototypes. This way I can validate the interactions before the developers even write a single line of code.</p>
                        <p>This method has been working well for me, but I have experience creating prototype using HTML/CSS with jQuery. I have also coded in Notepad before in a pinch.</p>
